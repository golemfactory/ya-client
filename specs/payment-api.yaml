  title: Yagna Payment API
  version: 1.6.3
  description: '
    Invoicing and Payments is a fundamental area of Yagna Ecosystem
    functionality. It includes aspects of communication between Requestor,
    Provider and a selected Payment Platform, which becomes crucial when
    Activities are executed in the context of negotiated Agreements. Yagna
    applications must be able to exercise various payment models, and the
    Invoicing/Payment-related communication is happening in parallel to
    Activity control communication. To define functional patterns of
    Requestor/Provider interaction in this area, Payment API is specified.


    An important principle of the Yagna Payment API is that the actual payment
    transactions are hidden behind the Invoice flow. In other words, a Yagna
    Application on Requestor side isn’t expected to trigger actual payment
    transactions. Instead it is expected to receive and accept Invoices raised
    by the Provider - based on Application’s Invoice Accept notifications, the
    Payment API implementation orchestrates the payment via a configured
    Payment platform.


    **NOTE:** This specification is work-in-progress.

        If the Allocation was connected with a Deposit the release amount from

        released funds can be assigned to a new Allocation with Deposit).

        A Debit Note is an artifact issued by the Provider to the Requestor,

        Debit Note is issued. This is expected to be used as trigger for payment
        in upfront-payment or pay-as-you-go scenarios.


        **NOTE:** Only Debit Notes with non-null paymentDueDate are expected to
        trigger payments.


        **NOTE:** Debit Notes flag the current Total Amount Due, which is
        accumulated from the start of Activity. Debit Notes are expected to
        trigger payments, therefore payment amount for the newly received Debit
        Note is expected to be determined by difference of Total Payments for
        the Agreement vs Total Amount Due.

        An Accepted Invoice/Debit Note cannot be subsequently Rejected.


        There is a difference between Paid and Settled - depending on a Payment

        Total Amount Due as indicated by received/accepted Debit Notes/Invoice.
        Settled indicates that the Provider has reliably received the Payments.
