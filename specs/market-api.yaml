    ## Yagna Market

    The Yagna Market is a core component of the Yagna Network, which enables
    computational Offers and Demands circulation. The Market is open for all
    entities willing to buy computations (Demands) or monetize computational
    resources (Offers).

    ## Yagna Market API

    The Yagna Market API is the entry to the Yagna Market through which
    Requestors and Providers can publish their Demands and Offers
    respectively, find matching counterparty, conduct negotiations
    and make an agreement.


    This version of Market API conforms with capability level 1 of the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zny_vfgWV-hcsKS7P-Kdr3Fb0dwfl-6T_cYKVQ9mkNg">
    Market API specification</a>.


    Market API contains two roles: Requestors and Providers which are
    symmetrical most of the time (excluding agreement phase).

        Returns Proposal related events:

        * `ProposalEvent` - Indicates that there is new Demand Proposal for
        this Offer.

        * `ProposalRejectedEvent` - Indicates that the Requestor has rejected
          our previous Proposal related to this Offer. This effectively ends a
          Negotiation chain - it explicitly indicates that the sender will not
          create another counter-Proposal.

        * `AgreementEvent` - Indicates that the Requestor is accepting our
          previous Proposal and ask for our approval of the Agreement.

        * `PropertyQueryEvent` - not supported yet.


        **Note**: When `collectDemands` is waiting, simultaneous call to
        `unsubscribeOffer` on the same `subscriptionId` should result in
        "Subscription does not exist" error returned from `collectDemands`.


        **Note**: Specification requires this endpoint to support list of
        specific Proposal Ids to listen for messages related only to specific
        Proposals. This is not covered yet.

        The Market Matching Mechanism, when resolving the match relation for the
        specific Demand-Offer pair, is to detect the “dynamic” properties required
        (via constraints) by the other side. At this point, it is able to query the
        issuing node for those properties and submit the other side’s requested
        properties as the context of the query.


        **Note**: The property query responses may be submitted in “chunks”, ie. the
        responder may choose to resolve ‘quick’/lightweight’ properties faster and
        provide response sooner, while still working on more time-consuming properties
        in the background. Therefore the response contains both the resolved properties,
        as well as list of properties which responder knows still require resolution.


        **Note**: This method must be implemented for Market API Capability Level 2.

        code. After the call is aborted or timed out, another `approveAgreement`
        call can be raised on the same `agreementId`.


        It returns one of the following options:

        * `Approved` - Indicates that the approved Agreement has been successfully
        delivered to the Requestor and acknowledged.
          - The Requestor side has been notified about the Provider’s commitment
            to the Agreement.
          - The Provider is now ready to accept a request to start an Activity
            as described in the negotiated agreement.
          - The Requestor’s corresponding `waitForApproval` call returns `Approved` after
            the one on the Provider side.

        * `Cancelled` - Indicates that before delivering the approved Agreement,
        the Requestor has called `cancelAgreement`, thus invalidating the
        Agreement. The Provider may attempt to return to the Negotiation phase
        by sending a new Proposal.


        **Note**: It is expected from the Provider node implementation to “ring-fence”
        the resources required to fulfill the Agreement before the ApproveAgreement
        is sent. However, the resources should not be fully committed until `Approved`
        response is received from the `approveAgreement` call.


        **Note**: Mutually exclusive with `rejectAgreement`.
